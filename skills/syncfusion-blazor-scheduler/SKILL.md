## Quick Start Example

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Schedule

<SfSchedule TValue="AppointmentData" Height="650px" @bind-SelectedDate="@CurrentDate">
    <ScheduleEventSettings DataSource="@DataSource"></ScheduleEventSettings>
    <ScheduleViews>
        <ScheduleView Option="View.Day"></ScheduleView>
        <ScheduleView Option="View.Week"></ScheduleView>
        <ScheduleView Option="View.WorkWeek"></ScheduleView>
        <ScheduleView Option="View.Month"></ScheduleView>
        <ScheduleView Option="View.Agenda"></ScheduleView>
    </ScheduleViews>
</SfSchedule>

@code{
    DateTime CurrentDate = new DateTime(2026, 3, 24);
    List<AppointmentData> DataSource = new List<AppointmentData>
    {
        new AppointmentData 
        { 
            Id = 1, 
            Subject = "Conference", 
            StartTime = new DateTime(2026, 3, 24, 9, 30, 0),
            EndTime = new DateTime(2026, 3, 24, 11, 0, 0)
        }
    };

    public class AppointmentData
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Subject { get; set; }
        public string Location { get; set; }
        public DateTime StartTime { get; set; }
        public DateTime EndTime { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public bool IsAllDay { get; set; }
        public string RecurrenceRule { get; set; }

        public Nullable<int> RecurrenceID { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. **CRUD Operations**
- **Create:** Use `AddEventAsync()` method or double-click cells for editor
- **Read:** Use `GetEventsAsync()` or `GetCurrentViewEvents()` or `GetBlockEventsAsync()`
- **Update:** Modify appointment and use `SaveEventAsync()`
- **Delete:** Use `DeleteEventAsync()` method or delete key for multi-select
- **Check availability:** Use `IsSlotAvailableAsync()` to prevent overlaps

### 2. **Appointment Management**
- **Readonly appointments:** Set `IsReadonly = true` on individual events or use `Readonly` property
- **Block time slots:** Set `IsBlock = true` to prevent scheduling on those slots
- **Overlapping control:** Use `AllowOverlap="false"` to prevent overlaps
- **Custom fields:** Add custom properties beyond built-in fields (Status, Priority, etc.)
- **Field mapping:** Use `ScheduleField` tags for custom field names

### 3. **Appearance Customization**
- **Templates:** Use `<Template>` for custom appointment HTML
- **EventRendered:** Apply dynamic CSS classes based on data
- **CssClass:** Apply predefined CSS classes from appointment data
- **Tooltips:** Enable with `EnableTooltip="true"` and customize with `TooltipTemplate`
- **Cell styling:** Use `OnRenderCell` event or `CellTemplate`

### 4. **Event Handling**
- **ActionBegin:** Intercept before operations (validate, cancel, check overlap)
- **ActionCompleted:** Execute after successful operations
- **EventRendered:** Customize appointment appearance
- **OnDragStart / OnResizeStart:** Control drag/resize behavior
- **TooltipOpening:** Conditionally show/hide tooltips

### 5. **View Management**
- Set `CurrentView` property to change active view
- Configure each view independently with view-specific properties
- Use `DisplayName` for custom view labels
- Extend views with `Interval` property (e.g., 3-day view)

### 6. **Recurring Events**
- Use standard iCalendar `RecurrenceRule` format (FREQ, INTERVAL, COUNT, UNTIL)
- Add `RecurrenceException` dates to exclude occurrences
- Use `RecurrenceID` for edited occurrences
- Support daily, weekly, monthly, yearly patterns with FREQ property

### 7. **Data Binding**
- Local: Bind `DataSource` to List<AppointmentData>
- Remote: Bind to HTTP service returning data
- Use `Query` property for server-side filtering
- Call `RefreshEventsAsync()` to reload data without full refresh

| `MaxDate` | Maximum date boundary | `MaxDate="new DateTime(2026,12,31)"` |
| `CssClass` | Custom CSS class for styling | `CssClass="custom-scheduler"` |
